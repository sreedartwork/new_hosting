mock hosting website
This web site was based on a project by Traversey Media.
I used the Foundation for websites frame-work this allowed me to focus on the functionality of the website.
Foundation for websites had very clear documentation that was easy to follow and understand the components.
Foundation includes a gulp file that has production build and browser-sync for live-reload.
Doing this project was an enjoyable process in learning to use this framework.
